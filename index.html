<h2 id="survivor">survivor by chuck palahniuk </h2>
<p> chuck palahniuk is a very good author, hes very good at going into very detail about absolutetly anything he can think of. he can go into complete detail about a tiny vial of test 500, all the way to to talking about a <strong>dirty black</strong> spork. but now lets get to the point of the book now, its starts off with a guy who i believe is partaking in home econimics, (basically just a housekeeper) he is a survivor of a  formalcreedish cult. its believed that the cult all killed themselves to deliver themselves to their leader. </p>

<h2>tinkering with <em>css</em> elements</h2>
<p id="communism">In June, the Victims of Communism Museum opened in Washington, DC, just a few blocks from the White House—but with none of the attention that greeted other recent additions to the city’s cultural landscape.
